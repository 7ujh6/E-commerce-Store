### Project Overview

Crown Clothing is a full-stack e-commerce application I built from the ground up as a self-directed project to gain deep, practical experience with modern web development. It was my primary vehicle for mastering the entire development lifecycle, from foundational concepts like component design and state management to advanced topics like asynchronous data flow and user authentication.

This project represents my passion for building functional, user-centric products and my commitment to self-driven learning and problem-solving.

### Core Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and sign-in functionality powered by Firebase Authentication.
*   **Shopping Cart:** A fully persistent shopping cart built with Redux for robust, predictable state management.
*   **Product Browsing:** A clean, responsive UI for browsing product categories and individual items.
*   **Checkout Process:** A simulated checkout and payment flow.

### Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, Redux, React Hooks, Apollo Client
*   **Backend & Database:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
*   **Styling:** Styled-Components
*   **Deployment:** Originally hosted on Heroku.

### Key Learning & Challenges

This project was a rigorous, self-taught deep dive into the complexities of building a real-world application. I tackled significant challenges, including mastering asynchronous processing with Redux-Saga, debugging complex state management issues without a team, and navigating the entire deployment process to a live production environment. It laid the foundational skills that have defined my professional career.
